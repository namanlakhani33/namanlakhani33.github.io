									<p>Led a Computer Vision based project in collaboration with Havard Medical School and Prof. Ayush Kumar, developing a mobile app that aids visually impaired people. Created a dataset of about 3000 images for 14 different brand logos. Trained and compared the performance of RetinaNet, MobileNet, and YoLov5 models on the dataset. Discovered that YoLov5 outperformed the other models with an Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 77.8%, while the Retinanet model performed at 62.3% mAP and MobileNet at 48.6% mAP.</p>

							<h3><br />Reevive Organisation (January, 2021 - March, 2021)</h3>
							<p class="box" align="justify"> I got the opportunity to be an active member of <a target="_blank" href="https://reevive.org/">Reevive</a>, an organisation that helps needy cancer patients by providing them financial help. I helped Dr. Sanket Mehta and his team to organise their own Database. I paid regular visits to Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai to track the usage of incoming funds. I also drafted a data collection form for written testimonials and feedbacks from the beneficiaries of the campaigns. Additionally, I helped the organisation revert back to the previous donors who donated whole-heartedly. I got to interact with a lot of people and come across personalities from various backgrounds and fields of the society, which helped me improve my social skills. </p>

							<h3>The Security Council - K.J.S.C.E. (2019 - 2020)<br /></h3>
							<p class="box" align="justify"> I was a member of the Security Council for the academic year 2019-2020, where the council had to ensure smooth and secure functioning and successful completion of the 3 main fests of K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering. During ABHIYANTRIKI, the Science and Technology Festival, we had to ensure that the sponsors had all their requests fulfilled and the participants also were able to participate in all the events. We also had to assist the Army personnels who had their exhibition of various equipments, machineries and guns. Our Sport Festival, SKREAM is one of the most competitive and is regarded as one of the best in India. During SKREAM, we had to verify all the registered participants and also take care of any serious injuries. Monitoring each event and lessing the friction among teams was our job. The Cultural Festival, SYMPHONY, is the most enjoyed and most attended by the students. Bollywood Celebrities from various fields like singing, acting and dancing have their performances and shows or are invited as judges. It is important to check what the attendees carry to live performances and verifying their identity. We had to manage the crowd just before the shows and also clear the exit allowing a smooth return for the 2000 to 4000 students once the events were over. Additionally, we had to go and receive judges, guests and personalities that were invited.</p>
